# **A User-Centered Investigation of Personal Music Tours** 


## **1. Problem Definition**  

How to best present music to listeners and how can this be achieved automatically with algorithms? Playlists are the most commonly used way in many streaming platforms and can be generated automatically. Can the interestingness of the played music to the listener be improved by automatically generated tours, which contain side or background information of the songs?

## **2. Motivation**  

When listening to music, people are often interested in a smooth and harmonious sequence of songs which suits their taste. Additionally, many also want to explore new music. Several platforms as Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube offer the benefit of arranging music automatically, even with regard to personal preferences and many people seem to enjoy these services, which require almost no effort from the user. One problem in this field is how to present the music to the user in the most interesting way. The most common approach is to use playlists, which can take information about the artists, genres or topics into account. Yet, there exist other ways than playlists. A radio show for example often interrupts the continuous play of music for side information or other entertainments. By doing so, the experience for the listener gets more interactive than just listening to the music. 

Another alternative are **tours**, where songs alternate with segues. A segue is a spoken informative sentence about the realtionship between the previous and the upcoming song. By this, previously unrelated songs can be linked for the user, generating a more interesting experience. A playlist, in contrast, can hence be seen as a plain ordered list of songs. In some contexts, tours are found to be superior to playlist.

The authors propose two algorithms to generate music tours, which aim to maximize the interestingness of the generated tours. They evaluate their results by interviewing participants of their study after their experience.

Previous works focused mainly on the task of recommendation; i.e. choosing the best upcoming song, or creating playlists with similarities between the songs (e.g. audio similarities like beats per minute, etc or web-based similarities like Wikipedia categories).
Whereas in this paper, the authors aim to maximize the interestingness of the tours an directly assess the experience of the users.

## **3. Method**  

Please write the methodology author have proposed.  
We recommend you to provide example for understanding it more easily.  

## **4. Experiment**  

In this section, please write the overall experiment results.  
At first, write experiment setup that should be composed of contents.  

### **Experiment setup**  
* Dataset  
* baseline  
* Evaluation Metric  

### **Result**  
Then, show the experiment results which demonstrate the proposed method.  
You can attach the tables or figures, but you don't have to cover all the results.  
  



## **5. Conclusion**  

Please summarize the paper.  
It is free to write all you want. e.g, your opinion, take home message(오늘의 교훈), key idea, and etc.
