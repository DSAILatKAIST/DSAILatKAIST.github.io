<h2 id="1-introduction">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The concept of Parallel Ranking of Ads and Creative in Real-Time Advertising Systems refers to the task of dynamically selecting the most appealing advertisement to users in real time. This proposes a new architecture where personalized content is arranged in parallel, rather than the traditional method of serially listing and ranking creative content. It also suggests an offline joint optimization model to correspond to this new architecture. The term “Creative” mentioned here refers to the display formats used in advertisements, such as images and videos, which serve as a bridge connecting users with products and enticing potential customers. By optimizing offline evaluation metrics, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through experiments, showing improvements in response time, click-through rate (CTR), and cost per thousand impressions (CPM).</p>

<p><img width="375" alt="image" src="../../images/DS503_24S/Parallel_Ranking_of_Ads_and_Creatives_in_Real_Time_Advertising_Systems/Figure1.png" /></p>

<p>$Figure 1$</p>

<p>The first column of Figure 1 shows the overall click-through rate (CTR) for three different creatives of the same product, demonstrating that even well-designed creatives can show poor performance. The second column presents gender-specific CTRs for different creatives of the same product, emphasizing the importance of personalized creative selection.</p>

<p>With advancements in AI technology, various creatives tailored to product attributes and styles are being generated, and their performance is rapidly improving. However, current recommendation systems face time and computational constraints in the two-stage cascade architecture of candidate search and ranking, which aims to narrow down billions of ads to thousands within a short period.</p>

<p>The research proposes separating creative ranking from traditional ad search to reduce latency and optimize the efficiency of creative ranking in advertising systems. This involves developing sophisticated models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction and offline learning ranking models that incorporate ad and creative features. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of creative influence estimation through parallel modeling and optimize creative ranking efficiency.</p>

<p>The techniques used in this research are summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> Peri-CR: Parallel estimation of creative ranking and ad ranking to reduce time and enable sophisticated modeling.</li> 
<li> JAC: Joint optimization to model interactions and dependencies between ads and creatives.</li>
<li> Optimization of NSCTR: Optimizing the offline evaluation metric NSCTR for feedback tasks related to creative ranking and enhancing model functionality for online performance.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These techniques aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of creative ranking within advertising systems by leveraging advanced modeling and optimization strategies.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="2-related-work">2. RELATED WORK</h2>

<p>Our research is closely related to CTR prediction and ranking within advertising systems. Here’s a brief overview of existing research in advertising ranking and creative ranking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising ranking: This involves techniques for selecting relevant items from a vast candidate pool using cascade ranking systems with recall and ranking stages. Researchers explore feature selection, interaction modeling, and user behavior modeling to enhance performance.
</li>
<li> Creative ranking: This area requires efficient online estimation due to large creative pools and sparse user feedback. Evaluating creative quality offline based on existing image and text content, it emphasizes online user feedback currently. Recent studies use methods like AES and HBM-VAM, employing tree structures and bandit approaches to optimize platform revenue.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our research is similar to CACS in optimizing creative ranking prior to ad ranking and employing joint optimization with distillation and shared embeddings. However, we separate the creative module from the main ad pipeline and enhance creative estimation through parallel modeling, enabling accurate creative evaluation.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="3-problem-formulation">3. PROBLEM Formulation</h2>

<p>An advertising platform tends to display advertisements with high eCPM(effective Cost Per Mille) to users, while eCPM is determined by the product of the CTR and CPC(Cost Per Click). $(eCPM = CTR · CPC · 1000)$. The scope of this work is constrained to ranking ads with the highest CTR from thousands of candidates, with less RT(response time). The problem formulation is as follows. Given the set of Ad $a$ as $({A_{1},A_{2},…,A_{M}})$, each Ads Am with a bundle of creative c, indicated as $({C^{1}_ {m},C^{2}_ {m} ,…,C^{n}_ {m}})$. The number of ad slots is $(L ≪ M)$, they will be displayed to users $u$. The ranking models output the scores in each ad and creative and select the top L ad and top 1 creative according to the scores. Formally, given a triple $(u,a,c)$, the ranking model predicts the score $z$ as follows:</p>

<p>$z=p(y =1 \vert u,a,c) \quad(1)$</p>

<p>where $p$ denotes the ranker model, and $y$ $\in$ ${0,1}$ is the label that denotes whether the user clicks the impressed ad. To simplify the formula notation, we will use x to represent the user-ad pair $(u,a)$ in the following. The permutation of combination is unacceptable both in time and compatibility, we transform the formula:</p>

<p>$p(y = 1 \vert x) \cdot p(c \vert x,y = 1) = p(c \vert x) \cdot p(y = 1 \vert x,c) \quad(2)$</p>

<p>While the ranking model widely adopts the softmax function to predict the click probability:</p>

<p>$ p(c \vert x) = \text{softmax} (\frac{ p(y \vert x, c)}{\sum_{c^{‘} \in \mathcal{C}_ N} p(y \vert x, c = c^{‘}_ {i})}) (3)$</p>

<p>Where $\sum_ {c^{‘} \in \mathcal{C}_ {N}} p(y \vert x,c = c^{‘} i) $ is an unknown constant. Combined with Equation2 and 3,</p>

<p>$f_ {\theta}(x) · e^{−f_ {\theta}(x)} = p(y = 1 \vert x) \cdot p(c \vert x, y = 1) \quad(4)$</p>

<p>Where $f_ {\theta}(x)$ denotes $p(y = 1 \vert x,c)$. Thus we decompose the permutation problem into the CTR prediction of ad and the creative distribution with the user and ad.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="4-methodology">4. METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p>We propose Peri-CR, a novel architecture for creative and ad ranking, along with the corresponding model framework JAC, which improves the performance of both ranking tasks and reduces the overall response time.

<h3 id="41-online-parallelism-architecture">4.1 Online Parallelism Architecture</h3>

<p>The three methodologies for ad and creative ranking are as follows, visually represented in Figure 2:</p>

<p><img src="../../images/DS503_24S/Parallel_Ranking_of_Ads_and_Creatives_in_Real_Time_Advertising_Systems/Figure2.png" alt="Figure2" /></p>

<p>$Figure 2$
The main modules and workflow of the online advertising system. (a) Multi-stage ad ranking system. (b) Pre-CR first
requests creative ranking then ad ranking. (c) Post-CR first requests ad ranking then creative ranking. (d) Peri-CR requests ad
ranking and creative ranking in parallel simultaneously.</p>
<ol>
<li>Post-CR: This approach involves placing creative ranking after ad ranking to save time and enable more sophisticated modeling based on the results of ad ranking. However, since the ad ranking phase cannot determine which creative will be used for the ads, performance may suffer.
</li>
<li>
Pre-CR (CACS): In contrast to Post-CR, this method aims to enhance ad ranking performance by evaluating creative for all ad candidates. However, this approach requires significant time to evaluate all advertising candidates and restricts the creative model to a simple vector-based model.
</li>
<li>
Peri-CR: This proposed method separates the creative ranking module from the main ad retrieval and ranking pipeline, running them in parallel. The ad ranker uses abundant user and ad features to estimate ad-level Click-Through Rate (CTR), while the creative ranker uses fewer inputs to estimate creative-level CTR. The creative-level CTR then determines the optimal creative to display for each ranked ad, and the ad-level CTR determines the final displayed ad sequence. This parallel, decoupled architecture offers several advantages, including eliminating dependencies between the ad and creative modules and allowing sufficient time for both to use more sophisticated models.
</li>
</ol>

<p>$Figure 3$ Framework of the proposed Joint optimization of Ad and Creative ranking(JAC), including two submodels: (a)Ad Ranking(AR) adopts deep cross network (DCN) as the main architecture to predict ad CTR, taking rich user and ad features as input. It also employs transformer to model user behavior sequence; (b)Creative Ranking(CR) uses a smaller network with fewer features, and leverages the AR output to estimate creative CTR.</p>

<h3 id="42-offline-joint-optimizationn">4.2 Offline Joint Optimizationn</h3>

<p>Using AR (Ad Ranking) and CR (Creative Ranking) to model and predict CTR (Click-Through Rate) has limitations as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AR: Biased CTR prediction due to lack of access to creative information.</li>
  <li>CR: Less accurate CTR estimates due to simultaneous evaluation of multiple candidates.</li>
</ol>

<p>To address this, a hierarchical model like the one shown in Figure 3, which integrates AR and CR offline, is proposed. This integration ensures mutual interaction between sub-models to enhance prediction accuracy. AR performs complex user behavior modeling using all features to predict ad-level CTR ($pctr_{ad}$), while CR estimates creative-level CTR ($pctr_{c}$) using simple features and rich creative characteristics through an MLP network.</p>

<p>Another input feature is AR pctrad, which undergoes log transformation and quantization before ad embedding. The quantized code is discretized by</p>

<p>$[ K \cdot \log_ {r+1}(1 + r · pctr_ {ad}) ]\quad(5)$</p>

<p>where K is the embedding size and r is a hyperparameter calculated for information gain. This embedding is initialized and connected with other feature embeddings as inputs to higher network layers. Since the quantization process (Equation 5) is non-differentiable, gradients cannot be directly propagated through it.</p>

<p>To handle the non-differentiable operation caused by quantization, gradients are directly copied from CR to AR during backpropagation. This allows CR to leverage information from AR to provide more accurate CTR estimates and maintain stability in CTR prediction during online inference.</p>

<p>By combining AR and CR into an integrated model to leverage their respective strengths, this approach enhances overall CTR prediction performance in advertising systems.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="43-quality-of-the-implicit-sub-ranking">4.3 Quality of the Implicit Sub-Ranking</h3>

<p>The performance of the creative ranking model is measured by designing NSCTR and discussing offline metrics. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a common metric calculated for all exposures, but introduces user bias, while GAUC focuses on the performance of ad ranking lists for each user. Simulation CTR (sCTR) is a metric designed for creative selection, evaluating the difference between selected creatives from offline data and those exposed online. However, sCTR can be affected by changes in sample distribution and may cause variations in CTR when there are few creative candidates for specific ads.</p>

<p>$Figure 4$
The results between offline metrics and online A/B CTR lift for 6 major creative ranking upgrades.</p>

<p>NSCTR is a metric that addresses these issues by approximating the CTR of samples where the creative selected by the offline model matches the creative exposed online using Algorithm 1. Validating the effectiveness of these metrics is a challenging task, with online A/B testing being the most definitive but time-consuming method to prove efficacy.</p>

<p>This underscores the importance of offline metrics that can be validated through correlation with results from online A/B testing. To demonstrate this, we analyzed six significant improvements in creative ranking over the past year, including bandit algorithms, personalized two-towers, and creative feature extraction. We computed four offline metric scores (AUC and GAUC for absolute lift, sCTR and NSCTR for relative lift) and their corresponding online CTR lifts for each improvement. Pearson correlation coefficients were high for NSCTR (0.988), AUC (0.741), and sCTR (0.636), but low for GAUC (-0.152). This analysis, depicted in Figure 4, indicates that NSCTR is a more reliable metric than others for the offline evaluation of creative ranking.

<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>his work presents significant contributions to improving ad and creative ranking in online advertising. It introduces a novel architecture for online parallel estimation of ad and creative ranking, allowing for sophisticated personalized creative modeling while reducing overall latency compared to traditional serial ranking methods. Additionally, an offline joint model is developed to enhance mutual awareness and collaborative optimization between ads and creatives in click-through rate (CTR) estimation, leading to improved accuracy.
Furthermore, the work optimizes offline evaluation metrics crucial for creative ranking, enhancing the correlation between offline assessments and real-world online performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach over existing methods, achieving superior performance in response time, CTR, and cost-per-mille (CPM) compared to serial ranking approaches.</p>
<h2 id="7-idea-proposal">7. IDEA PROPOSAL</h2>
<p>Although online and offline experiments have proven the above method to be effective, delays and computational constraints have forced the abandonment of large-scale joint rankers for advertising and creatives, which has limited system performance. Moreover, improvements in hardware and system design seem to enable better joint ranking without significant ranking. NSCTR correlates well with online metrics, but it is only possible to approximate real sample distributions, and it will be possible to accurately recover real distributions by identifying mechanical variables for causal inference. Finally, this research system separates offline creative production from online estimation. Personally, if we utilize AIGC, we believe that we will be able to integrate them to derive optimal ads in real time for each user.</p>
